# Assignment: Web Content Q&A Tool (UI-Focused)
Build a web-based tool where a user can enter one or more URLs, then ask questions based on the information from those pagesâ€”without relying on general knowledge. The tool should have a minimal, user-friendly interface (e.g., a single-page web app or hosted link) where we can:
* Input URLs to ingest their text/content.
* Ask questions about that content.
* View concise, accurate answers using only the ingested information.
Deliverables
* Live or Hosted Link to the UI (or clear instructions on how to run it locally) where we can test the Q&A functionality.
* Source Code (GitHub or similar) demonstrating how you perform content ingestion and retrieval to generate answers.
Time Constraint
* Complete this within 24 hours.
Evaluation Criteria
* Relevance & Accuracy of answers (grounded strictly in the scraped website content).
* UI/UX: Is the interface straightforward to use?
* Implementation Clarity: Is the code organized, well-documented, and maintainable?
